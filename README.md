Here you'll find interesting algorithms that I have implemented in C++. Source
code can be easily compiled using `CMake`. Otherwise you might need to update
project-specific `#include` statements to be relative to project tree structure.
Also note that each project contains all the files required for project to
compile.

Everything is brought to you at no extra cost, as far as you abide by the MIT
license agreements.

Cheers!
